## Overview
SPEED is a peer-reviewed database of software engineering related articles. We rely on the community to submit articles and our team of moderators and analysts to review them for publication and provide evidence if the claims can be accademicly backed or not.

## Features
- User-friendly interface to browse and search for academic papers.
- Advanced search functionality for efficient and precise results.
- Role-based access for students, educators, researchers, and software engineers.
- Paper categorization by topic, author, and date.
